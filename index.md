# Research fields
My research interests focus on applying computer vision technology into Medical Image Diagnosis, assist doctors to give accurate diagnosis through medical images (MRI, DCE-MRI, CT, mp-MRI). In April of 2017, I successfully gave my PhD dissertation defence, in title **ROI Contrast Enhancement and CNNs Adaptation to Medical Image Applications**. My dissertation includes two main contents: 1) Enhancing the contrast at each specific region of interest (ROI) in the application of Renal Compartments Segmentation based on DCE-MRI Images and in the application of Cerebrovascular Segmentation; 2) The adaptation of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks in the application of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in mp-MRI Images.
# Research Experiences
* **Title**: Renal Compartment Segmentation in DCE-MRI Images – In cooperation with Professor Kyung Hyun Sung – University of California, Los Angeles; Professor Tim Cheng – University of Santa Barbara – Los Angeles.

* **Title**: Cerebrovascular Segmentation in CTA Images – In copperation with Professor Aichi Chien – University of California, Los Angeles; Professor Tim Cheng – HongKong Univeristy of Science and Technology.

* **Title**: Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in MP-MRI Images. In cooperation with Professor Tim Cheng – HongKong University of Science and Technology; Professor Liang Wang – Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Professor Kyung Hyun Sung – University of California, Los Angeles.
